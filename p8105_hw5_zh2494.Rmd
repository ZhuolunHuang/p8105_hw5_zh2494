# question 1
```{r}
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, state),
         resolution = case_when(
           disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
           disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
           disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved")) %>% 
  relocate(city_state) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "TulsaAL")
```

Let's focus on Baltimore, MD.
```{r}
baltimore_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "BaltimoreMD")

baltimore_summary = 
  baltimore_df %>% 
  summarize(
    unsolved = sum(resolution == "unsolved") ,
    n = n()
  )
baltimore_test =
  prop.test(
  x = baltimore_summary %>% pull(unsolved), 
  n = baltimore_summary %>% pull(n))

baltimore_test %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```
there is 0.6455 that unsolved homicide in Baltimore unsolved
The CI is from 0.628 to 0.663
